 * Authored by Rick Mark - 2020 from USB-IF DFU 1.1 spec
 *
 * This includes:
 *
 * - A DFU specific USB configuration descriptor
 * - DFU request and response structures and commands
 *
 * Note all descriptors are declared '__attribute__((packed))' so that:
 *
 * [a] they never get padded, either internally (USB spec writers
 *     probably handled that) or externally;
 *
 * [b] so that accessing bigger-than-a-bytes fields will never
 *     generate bus errors on any platform, even when the location of
 *     its descriptor inside a bundle isn't "naturally aligned", and
 *
 * [c] for consistency, removing all doubt even when it appears to
 *     someone that the two other points are non-issues for that
 *     particular descriptor type.
